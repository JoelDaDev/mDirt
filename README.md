_making Datapacks is really tedious – mDirt makes it easy._

### Notice
Hey there! I am the original dev, `TheJupiterDev`, under a new account after being locked out of my old account.
The only version supported as of now is the `Mounts of Mayhem` release, `1.21.11`.
As soon as the next minecraft drop, `26.1` releases, `1.21.11` support will be dropped.
